**Course Website:** [Unique #19065](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1178879) or [Unique #19070](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1178880)

**Course Description**: Mathematical equations governing fluid flow in reservoirs; numerical methods to solve the equations; numerical reservoir simulation; treatment of wells; history matching; a simulation project performed using a commercial simulator. Restricted to students admitted to major sequence in geosystems engineering and hydrogeology or petroleum engineering. 


**Prerequisites:** Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 323L

**Book:** Most of the reservoir simulation textbooks are out-dated and/or are geared towards graduate students. Therefore, I suggest printing out the provided powerpoint notes this semester and using them as a guide. There are several books that would make a good reference which are included below. If you feel the need to buy a book, Dr. Balhoff suggests the one by Chen.

Additionally, Dr. Balhoff has a manuscript for a textbook he is writing that may be downloaded from Canvas and used as a reference.
