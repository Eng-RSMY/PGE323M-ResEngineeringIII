## PGE 334M - Reservoir Engineering III  


**Instructor:** John T. Foster, Ph.D.  
**Office:** PGE 3.108  
**Phone:** 512-471-6972  
**Email:** [john.foster@utexas.edu](mailto:john.foster@.utexas.edu)  

**Class Location:** CPE 3.114
**Class Time:** T-Th 10:00 - 11:30 AM  
**Office Hours:** F 9:00 AM - 10:30 PM and by appointment   


**Course Website:** [https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1234497](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1234497)

**Course Description**: Mathematical equations governing fluid flow in reservoirs; numerical methods to solve the equations; numerical reservoir simulation; treatment of wells; history matching; a simulation project performed using a commercial simulator. Restricted to students admitted to major sequence in geosystems engineering and hydrogeology or petroleum engineering. 


**Prerequisites:** Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 323L

**Book:** Most of the reservoir simulation textbooks are out-dated and/or are geared towards graduate students. Therefore, I suggest printing out the provided powerpoint notes this semester and using them as a guide. There are several books that would make a good reference which are included below.  

Additionally, Dr. Balhoff has a manuscript for a textbook he is writing that may be downloaded from Canvas and used as a reference.
